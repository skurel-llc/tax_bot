 Product Name

Maven – AI-Powered Tax & Financial Intelligence Assistant for Nigeria

 Version

v1.0

 Prepared For

Founders, Product, Engineering, Partnerships, and Investors


 1. Product Overview

Maven is an AI-powered conversational assistant designed to help Nigerian businesses and professionals understand, comply with, and optimize their tax and financial obligations. Maven provides accurate, easy-to-understand answers grounded in official Nigerian tax laws, regulations, and circulars, while also acting as a gateway to invoicing tools, licensed tax professionals, audit firms, and paid advisory services.

In the long term, Maven evolves from a tax chatbot into a real-time financial co-pilot that can analyze financial data, generate reports, forecast outcomes, and participate in meetings to provide live financial guidance.


 2. Problem Statement

 Current Challenges in Nigerian Tax & Finance

 Nigerian tax laws (CITA, PITA, VAT Act, FIRS circulars, state tax laws) are complex, fragmented, and frequently updated.
 SMEs and startups struggle to understand compliance requirements, leading to penalties and lost opportunities.
 Access to qualified tax professionals is expensive and often reactive rather than proactive.
 Financial records are poorly structured, making tax filing and decision-making error-prone.
 Existing software focuses on filing and accounting, not understanding, guidance, and decision support.
